{% comment %} ATI Internship: Site Redesign and Interactable Map
Redesigning ATI's main site and prototyping a functional world map

Problem Statement
How can we increase the amount of clicks for the "Take Action Now" button on the homepage banner? Additionally, how can we provide an intuitive and more stylized aesthetic to ATI's pages?
Team
Individual work under supervision of ATI's Communications Manager, Aubrey McMahan.
Overview
In my three month internship with ATI, I was in charge of redesigning the ATI page in order to provide a better experience for visitors. I was also tasked to improve the homepage's "Take Action Now" button in order to increase interaction.
Programs Used
Figma, Photoshop
Brainstorm and Research
Notes and Insights
ATI's 'Take Action Now' button had very little interactions (7) despite being shown on main page
Site looks stiff and rigid, no round corners, shadows, etc
Article organization poor, too crowded and bunched
Proposed Solution
ATI's 'Take Action Now' button suffers from the lack of depth shown in the page, thus making it seem as if it is not clickable.
In order to truly modernize and clean up the site, we will need to instill motion to this page as well as establishing divides for hierarchy and differentiation. 
Original Pages

Home
Take Action Now button has no depth. Either background image opacity too high, or I redesign button to place more emphasis on it.
Programs, Volunteer, and Donate tabs look flat and non-clickable, even though they are
Where We Work can be interactive rather than a static image. Will make it easier to add or remove countries over time too.



Events
Lack of borders and organization for each event aside from one dividing line.
Centering is off
No external links that can provide additional content
Events constantly replaced, but never archived


News
Layout of articles condenses information very poorly
Lack of depth and other buttons that expand on information
Mock-ups and New Features

Homepage
Black fading gradient applied to banner, bolded and underlined text in order to make Take Action Now button easier to see + white button.
Carousel swipe for upcoming events rather than a static image of only one.
Added a Learn More tab to divide elements and gave each tab rounded corners and shadows.
Newspage
Changed layout to F style to improve readability and cohesion
Bolded title text and added a colored read more link




Events
Events are structured better and additional links to either learn more or RSVP
Most recent event and archived events tab added in new dropdown menu to save and search all events
Filter dropdown tab and calendar added to find specific events

Interactive Map
Mock-up of a global map that shows ATI's involvement globally. Color coded based on type of involvement that can be filtered on and off through checkbox


Reflection
My internship at Anti-Human Trafficking International gave me my first real work experience and I learned a lot about scheduling and time management during my time. Compared to previous projects, I was given more flexibility and autonomy on ideation and creation. The site needed UI improvements, and I believe I was able to do so through the addition of new features and polished uniform elements.
Presenting my mockups and design process in front of the board of executives helped me refine my presentation skills and how I convey information to people of all technical backgrounds. {% endcomment %}
