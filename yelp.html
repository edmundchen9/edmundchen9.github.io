    Yelp Redesign
Quality of life changes and incentives to increase user traffic


Problem Statement
How might we increase the number of monthly reviews given on the Yelp desktop app?
Overview
I and two other group members were assigned with redesigning Yelp's desktop app page in order to increase the number of monthly reviews on its platform, and how we can achieve this. We focused on adding elements that would improve the quality of life for users, as well as an original feature that will incentivize users to continue using their account
Team
Group Project consisting of 3 members (including myself)
Programs Used
Figma, Photoshop, Whimsical
Brainstorm and Research
Interviews: 6 Indirect and 5 Ethnographic (Usability)
Key Takeaways:
Users either too lazy or not compelled enough to write reviews

Users only consider reviewing based off a really positive or negative experience. Would be more willing to review if provided incentives

Users typically use yelp to explore new options based on reviews and attached photos​​​​​​​

User Personas, Use Case,  Journey Map

User Persona Use Case
Hungry wants to find a new restaurant through Yelp. She decides on a restaurant but finds it difficult to navigate the surplus of info. She finally reaches the reviews, but she is having trouble with recommendations due to a lack of buzzwords and reviews with images.
Hungry has a good time, but does not leave a review because it was uneventful and not incentivized to do so. She closes Yelp and forgets about it until the next time she wants to eat out.

Pain Points: 
No incentive, backtracking is not easy, crowded pages with no tabs






Journey Map

Proposed Solution: Concise Feed & Incentives
Consolidating the business page with drop-down menus to prevent needless scrolling and a shortcut to the reviews section through a scrolling tab on the right. 
Furthermore, a brand new feature: Yelp Rewards. Businesses can partner with Yelp by offering promos when users leave reviews on their page
Flow Chart

Wireframes

Homepage
Redesigned homepage to direct attention to "first review" button, which was originally hardly noticeable.
Emphasized button in hopes of encouraging new users to write their first review
Quick links redirect to recommended/trending restaurants in local area in hopes of increasing recurring users
Business Page
Original business page had abundance of relevant information, but not all were necessary to show at once.
Dropdown menus will tidy of page to prevent needless scrolling while condensing all information
Number of reviews next to business name is now clickable (underlined) and will send user to reviews tab. Original page does NOT scroll user to reviews.
Review highlights and "review" button displayed on right side of page to provide user with relevant reviews throughout page




Deals and Rewards Page
New original page for incentivizing users to review
Features best deals at local restaurants and other businesses
Tab that shows what you earn by reviewing and other stats such as lifetime savings
Mock-Ups
Homepage
"Write your first review!" button implemented
Uniform image dimensions and a larger emphasis on places/deals/businesses around you





Business Page
Dropdown tabs for specific topics, easy to navigate for what you want to look for
Sidebar contains additional images and keywords to increase ease of usability for users
Recommended food item featured in menu tab alongside pictures for a more authentic look of the items

Deals and Rewards + Claim Demo
Ticket stub icons with corresponding symbols and nice colored gradients
Filter rewards with buttons up above
Upon finishing review, thank you screen to confirm completion as well as a ticket stub reward


Figma Prototype
Please set to fit width under options for best user experience!

Reflection
It was a privilege working with two amazing group members who also put in their absolute best in order to create a satisfactory redesign. 

As my first project that followed the UX lifecycle, I was somewhat surprised at the amount of brainstorming and researched needed prior to actually designing the site. I initially was confused why the project length was a whole week, because I thought designing pages with group members would speed the time up much more, but I never factored in research, brainstorming, collaborating with members for additional input, etc. There was a lot of first times for me in this project, but I learned a lot about reasons behind motivations for people. {% endcomment %}
